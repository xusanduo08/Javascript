## Organizing State

<a id="organizing-state-only-redux-state"></a>
### Do I have to put all my state into Redux? Should I ever use React's `setState()`?

There is no “right” answer for this. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state. 

***Using local component state is fine***.  As a developer, it is _your_ job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live.  Find a balance that works for you, and go with it.

Some common rules of thumb for determining what kind of data should be put into Redux:

- Do other parts of the application care about this data?
- Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?
- Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?
- Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?
- Do you want to cache the data (ie, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?

There are a number of community packages that implement various approaches for storing per-component state in a Redux store instead, such as [redux-ui](https://github.com/tonyhb/redux-ui), [redux-component](https://github.com/tomchentw/redux-component), [redux-react-local](https://github.com/threepointone/redux-react-local), and more.  It's also possible to apply Redux's principles and concept of reducers to the task of updating local component state as well, along the lines of `this.setState( (previousState) => reducer(previousState, someAction))`.

### Can I put functions, promises, or other non-serializable items in my store state?

It is highly recommended that you only put plain serializable objects, arrays, and primitives into your store. It's *technically* possible to insert non-serializable items into the store, but doing so can break the ability to persist and rehydrate the contents of a store, as well as interfere with time-travel debugging.

If you are okay with things like persistence and time-travel debugging potentially not working as intended, then you are totally welcome to put non-serializable items into your Redux store.  Ultimately, it's _your_ application, and how you implement it is up to you.  As with many other things about Redux, just be sure you understand what tradeoffs are involved.

<a id="organizing-state-nested-data"></a>
### How do I organize nested or duplicate data in my state?

Data with IDs, nesting, or relationships should generally be stored in a “normalized” fashion: each object should be stored once, keyed by ID, and other objects that reference it should only store the ID rather than a copy of the entire object. It may help to think of parts of your store as a database, with individual “tables” per item type. Libraries such as [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) and [redux-orm](https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/redux-orm) can provide help and abstractions in managing normalized data.
