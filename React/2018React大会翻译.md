Hello everyone, welcome to React Conf. I'm really excited to be here. I'm really excited for the stuff that we have to announce for you this week.My name is Sophie Alpert on the Internet. I manage the React core team at Facebook by any manager that you use.React is doing great our NPM downloads are up 70% year-over-year, the chrome dev tools extension for React dev tools has been installed by one and a quarter million developers and I can show you this list of companies that's using React although at this point it's so long,it's kind of hard to tell how much it changes each year.For another point of data we can look at Google Trends which shows web search traffic,so it searches for React continue to go up, hopefully that means more people are using React, not that it's getting more confusing.But for a point of  comparison we can look at a trade jquery which we have just passed for the first time in history. But this also shows that we have a lot more room to grow. 1分20秒
