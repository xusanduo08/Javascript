Hello everyone, welcome to React Conf. I'm really excited to be here. I'm really excited for the stuff that we have to announce for you this week.My name is Sophie Alpert on the Internet. I manage the React core team at Facebook by any manager that you use.React is doing great our NPM downloads are up 70% year-over-year, the chrome dev tools extension for React dev tools has been installed by one and a quarter million developers and I can show you this list of companies that's using React although at this point it's so long,it's kind of hard to tell how much it changes each year.For another point of data we can look at Google Trends which shows web search traffic,so it searches for React continue to go up, hopefully that means more people are using React, not that it's getting more confusing.But for a point of  comparison we can look at a trade jquery which we have just passed for the first time in history. But this also shows that we have a lot more room to grow. I was procrastinating when I was writing this talk so I was curious to see what else React is more popular than whoops spoiled my joke. But React is more popular I found out than renewable energy,it's also more popular than orange juice, just think about how common orange juice is right.And not only that it's more popular than renewable energy and orange juice puttogether,so I think we have a lot to be proud of .But ,enough about these numbers, what I really like to talk about today is our mission with React.Ever since React was released in 2013, our overarching goal, our primary mission has been to make it easier to build great UIs and so when we're adding new features we always try to be very deliberate, we want to consider a bunch of things when deciding whether to add a new API, if it makes it possible to do something you couldn't do before,if it can dramatically simplify the code around React in your components and libraries so that you all have less work to do and users have less code to download ,that's a win. Or if it hepls encourage best practices,  like code splitting, if we make it easier to code split your app into multiple bundles then our hope is that your apps will end up being faster so that's why we add things like  React dot lazy which we announced two days ago.You might have seen it .But thinking about this mission, make it easier to build great UIs,there are a lot of different ways that we approach this, one way we do this is tring to smplify things that are hard.If you saw Dayton Dan Abramov stalk from JS conf Iceland then you saw a sneak peek at suspense which is our idea about how to dramatically simplify what's required to do data fetching, code splitting and any kind of async data dependencies in your app.

Now another way to improve React is by focusing on performance.If you app run faster your users are going to enjoy using it more. Conversely, if your app is laggy, if your app is janky then your users aren't gonna have a great time, so we try to spend time on making React so faster.Because if React is faster out of the box you all need to spend less time optimizing your own code.One recent performance related effort  that Dan also talked about in Iceland as what we call time slicing,this is going to let you make sure that the most important renders in your app are processed first, in order to unblock the main thread and make your apps faster.And a third angle that we approach our mission from is developer tooling to help you debug and understand your app.From the start, React has included developer friendly warnings to help point out problems before you might otherwise notice them and we've had the Reactive tools extension whick lets you inspect and debug your components trees.And inn React 16-5 we introduce a new profiler, it's a second. I don't know what's up with this clicker a second tab. A second tab there, profiler tab, that helps you understand what's happening in your app and optimize it. So, Suspense, Time Slicing and the Profiler are three of the new features that we've been working on over the last year.We're really excited to tell you more about them.But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.You're gonna have to wait till Andrew and Brian's talk tomorrow morning to hear about that. Today I want to take a step back and focus on something else. What I like to ask is what in React still sucks. And I have three problems that I would like to talk through.

The first one is reusing logic between multiple components. In React our main building block for our applications is a component, and components form the foundation of the two main patterns for sharing code in React apps between components which are Higher-order components and Render props. Both of these parrerns are great for some cases, but they also come with a significant downside. You need to restructure your app anytime you want to pull one of  these in more complicated examples. This leads to what I call wrapper hell, most of us have seen components trees that look something like this. And the nesting you end up with  maks it difficult to follow the data flow through the app. It would be really nice if there was some way to reuse this sort of stateful logic without needing to change the component hierarchy, right. 

The second problem I would like to talk about is giant components whose logic is just sort of a tangled mess. When you look at a thousand line React component chances are the logic is going to be split across a lot of different lifecycle methods in a way that's pretty difficult to follow. Let's look at an example. Let's say we have a class component, and in its component did mount method it does a few different things: it subscribes to a database, it sends off a network requests and it starts a timer. Well, if we look at the component will unmount method, then we're going to see basically exact three opposite things: it needs to unsubscribe from the store, it needs to cancel that network request and it needs to stop the timers. And when it comes to implementing component did update, the logic tends to get even tricker because you need to compare the old and new props and also mirror it again the same tasks that you have in your other lifecycle methods.Uh, in this example, each call here is just one line so this is actually a lot simpler than what you normally see in your components. In real-world components you often end up with an even more tangled mess, because each individual task has to be split across different lifecycle methods, that makes it hard to tell if , for instance, you forgot to clean up one of the resources when you're unmounting your component. It's pretty hard to see that from the code.

And the third thing that sucks is the class, understanding classes in Javascript can be pretty tricky, and today we require you to use class components in order to access state and lifecycles. If you've even taken a function component and converted it to a class to add some state, you know that there's a fair amount of boilerplate that's required in order to just define a class component. Most beginners and many experienced devs also tell us that the way binding and this work in classes is pretty confusing. It's annoying to think about it .And we also frequently hear that people don't exactly know when to use function components partly because there's always this fear that you're gonna have to convert it to a class later anyway. And so you're like should I, should I do it now? I don't know. And so I claim classes are hard for humans, uh, but it's not just humans, I claim the classes are also hard for machines. If you ever looked at a minified component file, you'll see that all the method names are still unminified. And that if you have a method that's completely unused, it doesn't get stripped out. That's because it's hard to tell at compile time exactly how all the methods fit together. We also found that classes make it difficult for us to implement hot reloading reliably. And finally when we were prototyping an optimizing compiler to improve the performance of React components, we found that classes can encourage some patterns that make it a lot harder for compilers to optimize. So here are the three problems that we have:reusing logic, giant components, and classes. So reusing logic because you often end up with this wrapper hell.Giant components because you have the logic split across different lifecyles. And classes which are difficult for both humans and machines. So we think we have a solution that can help with all three of these. We're really excited to share it with you to tell you more about it . I want to welcome up Dan Abramov.
